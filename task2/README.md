# Language(Java):
          Java is fundamentally object-oriented, The code is so robust because Java objects contain no references 
          to data external to themselves
          The language is considered to be very simple; however, it comes with a library of classes that offer commonly 
          used utility functions that most Java programs canâ€™t work without.
# Design Choice:
          Singelton Design pattern is used to implement the TopologyMemory to preserve only one instance(copy)
          of the content of the memeory
